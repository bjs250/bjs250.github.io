# Job to be done

Drift is a B2B company specializing in conversational marketing. It's main offering is to install a virtual assistant on a customer company's marketing website ("a chatbot") to interact with site visitors, targeting two personas: end users that want to initiate a business deal with the company, and end users that require technical assistance.

During the interaction between the chatbot and the end user, Drift collects, aggregates, and logs information about the end user, the company they are from, and the conversation itself. This is fed into "Prospector", Drift's website analytics platform
